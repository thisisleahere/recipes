##### serves 1
The key to nailing a Dark and Story is the precise ratio between the spice of the ginger beer and the richness of the rum. Depending on which brands you use, you may want to play around with the proportions. No true Bermudian would put lime juice in his D&S, but here in the States, that's how it comes. Frankly, we prefer it with the lime, so dump it in for an extra layer of flavor.



## Ingredients:

- 2 oz. *dark* rum
- 3 oz. ginger beer
- 1/2 oz. lime juice *(optional)*
- Collins glass 


## Directions:

1. Combine the rum, the ginger beer, and the lime juice in a tall glass full of ice cubes.
2. *Stir well.*
3. Garnish with a lime wedge.
