# Steak With Roasted Parsnips and Tomatoes

**Description:**

Simple enough to make for just two or four, but impressive enough to serve at a dinner party. This two-part meal appears, on its surface, to be much more involved than what the recipe actually requires. The vegetables, tossed with oil, herbs, salt, and pepper, roast in the oven at a high temperature, while you quickly sear the steaks over the stovetop. Serve the meat along your roasted vegetables, and add a green salad, if you’d like, for a delicious, protein-packed (and low-carb) supper. And the roasting trick works for any root vegetable; try it with potatoes, carrots, or beets for a twist.

**Ingredients:**

* 1½ pounds parsnips, cut into 2-inch pieces, halved or quartered if thick
* 1½ 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 1 bunch scallions, trimmed
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* ¼ cup plus 1 teaspoon olive oil
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* 4 strip or rib-eye steaks (½ inch thick; about 1½ pounds total)

**How to make it**

***STEP 1:*** Heat oven to 450° F. Toss the parsnips, tomatoes, scallions, thyme, ¼ cup of the oil, and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.

***STEP 2:*** Cover the dish with foil and roast until the juices are bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to roast until the parsnips are tender, 10 to 15 minutes more.

***STEP 3:*** Meanwhile, heat the remaining teaspoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the steaks with ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper., Cook, in batches, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of each piece registers 130° F, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.

***STEP 4:*** Let the steaks rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with the vegetables.

***STEP 5:*** SERVE AND ENJOY!!!
